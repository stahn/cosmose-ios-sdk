 `CosmoseSDK` is a main entry class of Cosmose SDK library.

 ## Application configuration
 
 Cosmose SDK require that the app provide a unique Cosmose SDK App Identifier via an app specific Info.plist file as well as custom URL scheme (`xcosmose`) need to be defined for the app. For more details please refer to the documentation under https://bitbucket.org/Cosmose/cosmose-ios-sdk/wiki/Home . Example app using Cosmose SDK and Facebook login can be found at https://bitbucket.org/Cosmose/cosmose-ios-sdk/src/master/CosmoseSDKDemo/ .

 Use this method from `application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation` method of `UIApplicationDelegate`.
 This method is responsible for handling interapp communication with other Cosmose partners apps. See the example implementation of `UIApplicationDelegate` method for handling custom URL scheme. This method will detect Cosmose URL scheme (prefixed with `xcosmose`) and process it properly. It is safe to provide URL other than prefixed with `xcosmose`, althought in this case `NO` will be returned. Thus the result of this method can be forwarded as a result of `application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation` if the app does not handle custom URL schemes other than the one that is required by Cosmose SDK.

 This method should be called as soon as fb session is established. One of the possible entry point for calling this method is `FBLoginViewDelegate`'s method `loginViewShowingLoggedInUser:loginView`.
 Either way it is possible to provide `FBSession` instance by directly calling `[FBSession activeSession]` from the app's login flow.
